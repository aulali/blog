      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <p>This week my MakerSquare classes started on Monday and Wednesday night, along with my Thursday night Photoshop class that started the week before. Busy! I haven't had much down time but it's felt really good to spend my evenings learning things that I enjoy.</p>
      <p>I used to use PhotoShop pretty heavily when I was an art major. Since many moons have passed since I was in college, I was afraid my skills would be woefully out of date. Technology changes in the blink of an eye. But, I've been pleasantly surprised so far all the tools I've learned in PhotoShop class are like long-lost friends! Picking them up again has been so much fun. I hope to use my Photoshop skills to complement the front-end skills I"m learning at MakerSquare.</p>
