      <h1>Up And Running</h1>
      <p>I started training for a half-marathon a few months ago. Getting back into running in the summer heat was daunting. My first run on the trail with my friend Margaret left me feeling it a little intimidtaed. It was 6 p.m. and sweltering and by the end of the run, I had some doubts. But, I changed my work schedule so I could start running early in the morning before starting my day, and that's made all the difference. I take the bus to the gym at 6:30 a.m., and once I'm there, there's nothing to do but start running. Now it's September. Yestrday Margaret and I did 11.3 miles, and the race is next week. I'm actually really looking forward to it! </p>
